# Codes_ComplexSignal
This repository is for open access to source codes and data for the manuscript "Complex signals alter recognition accuracy and conspecific acceptance thresholds", https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0482 .

1. **PLEASE READ** the notes at the beginning of each file, containing the key parameters for simulations and notes for plotting. 

2. In "codes" folder, because of the random number generators files (dSfmt), please **DO NOT** change the relative location of these files. The environments for simulations are (1) clang-800.0.42.1 (Mac OSX 10.12.3), and (2) gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.10). 

3. In "codes" folder, files ending with "gHP" are for generating time series of trait dynamics, where as files with "rgHP" are for generating repeated simulations.

4. In "simulated data" folder, "m1" covers all data in the main text, while "m2" presents all the data from variable cost models. Within each folder, "thr" represents acceptance threshold only, and "cov" represents threshold+ undesirables are evolvable). 

Please email to "ming.liu@zoo.ox.ac.uk" if there is any problems about the data or the code, thanks!
