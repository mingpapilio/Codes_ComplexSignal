# Codes_ComplexSignal
This repository is for open access to source codes and data for the manuscript "Complex signals alter recognition accuracy and conspecific acceptance thresholds", https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0482 .

1. **PLEASE READ** the notes at the beginning of each file, containing the key parameters for simulations and notes for plotting. 

2. In **_codes_** folder, because of the random number generators files (dSfmt), **please DO NOT CHANGE** the relative location of these files. The environments for simulations are (1) clang-800.0.42.1 (Mac OSX 10.12.3), and (2) gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.10). 

3. In **_codes_** folder, files ending with **_gHP_** are for generating time series of trait dynamics, where as files with **_rgHP_** are for generating repeated simulations.

4. In **_simulated data_** folder, **_m1_** covers all data in the main text, while **_m2_** presents all the data from variable cost models. Within each folder, **_thr_** represents acceptance threshold only, and **_cov_** represents threshold+ undesirables are evolvable). 

Please email to "ming.liu.ac@gmail.com" if there is any problems about the data or the code, thanks!
